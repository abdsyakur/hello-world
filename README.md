# hello-world

Another guided tutorial on github.

I like visual basic for application in a way that it is 
visually clear for a beginner or enthusiast like me.

For years I've been with Ms. VBA in Ms. Excel, exactly
since it was Ms. Office 2003.

The above text was 4 years ago, and I return for a reason.
What great about this is, I already forgot what I've done before.
Just because of that reason, and the file is still here, this is great.
